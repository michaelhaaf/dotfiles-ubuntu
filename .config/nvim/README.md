# Key mappings

I assign the key mappings rationally aiming to make them efficient and easy to remember. 

* Multiple leader keys

  Other than `<Space>` that is set as the general leader key, `\` and `,` act as the leader keys for toggling and LSP respectively.
  
* Mnemonic

  Key bindings are organized using mnemonic prefixes like `<Leader>b` for buffer, `<Leader>f` for fuzzy finder, `<Leader>w` for window, etc.
  
* Consistent

  Similar functionalities have the same key binding throughout my dotfiles. For example, `,` and `.` for moving tabs in both kitty and Neovim.
